# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for a project on predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning models. The project was made in collaboration with  [MarinaGRey](https://github.com/MarinaGRey). It focuses on preprocessing the Titanic dataset and evaluating various machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes.

## Files

- **BestModel.RData**: Contains the final trained model and associated functions.
- **Report.pdf**: A comprehensive report detailing the project, including data preprocessing, model evaluation, and conclusions.
- **code.R**: The R script used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **titanic_train.RData**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.

## Description of `code.R`

### Project Metadata and library loading 

### Data Preprocessing

### Model Training and Evaluation

The script includes code for:
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Training various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results

The script saves the best-performing model and its evaluation metrics to `BestModel.RData`.

## Report

The `Report.pdf` provides an in-depth analysis of the project, including:
- Detailed explanations of data preprocessing steps.
- Evaluation of different machine learning models.
- Final conclusions and recommendations based on model performance.
